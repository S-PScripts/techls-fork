# Lua-scripts
Some of my stuff. Please note that not everything here is made by me but almost everything is.

A lot of scripts that I tend to add to this repository are old as well, which explains why some are coded overly terrible. I just like to share some of my work and those may have been private at some point, only for me to release them here months upon months later
