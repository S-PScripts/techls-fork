     This should only be ran if people are autocrashing or posing some form of threat I guess.
     Yes this can time the server out if you don't leave on your 2 other clients


     USAGE: Get 3 clients in one server. If someone is autocrashing just block the crasher on all 3 accounts and hit the play button,
     it should force yall into the same server as all of you got the same ping.

     If none of your alts have perm then run a script before joining the game that gives you a pad.

     Once all 3 clients are in the game and have admin, just execute this but you have to do it before the crasher joins.
     Now once you run this, it will spam the http queue which will delay perm for about 3 minutes. Now you can do whatever you want. 
     But just to be safe, don't let the crasher get a pad. Just punish them so they're trapped.

     If the crasher doesn't leave then just wait it out anyway as they're clueless most of the time. 
     But if the crasher is blocked then you can just force-create a server in like 5-10 seconds so you could do this every 3 minutes

     If the crasher leaves then get the server to fill up, (even if they rejoin, the admin shouldn't work until all cars have been given)
     Just run this again whenever the server hits 5/6 just incase that person is waiting in the queue just to crash you.
     As long as you ran this before the crasher spawned then you should be good. Perm and person299's admin will be given to the player when they spawn, not when they join (Tested btw)

    Also for the love of god don't use this against a crasher that doesn't have perm nor persons.
    They will just grab a pad and crash it since pads still work regardless of perm being broken in the server
